If you don’t know me I’m M to the B
Coming in hard, you’d better watch it Sophie
You think you’re the only girl doing grime
M to the B says ‘step in line’
Coming in hard, with my bars
Sophie Aspin is about to get parred
Read your bars off your iPhone 4
I don’t do that shit, I do it hardcore
Got murked by Little T
Now you’re getting murked by me
You shagged bare lads, you’re a little sket
Have you heard your bars, they’re fucking pep
Fucking pep yeah that’s what they are
Now listen carefully to my sick bars
They scream my name like ‘yar yar yar’
Sophie yeah, you’re a little whore
Looking at your face, what the fuck’s your contour
Do you want me to lend you a blender
I’m being serious, I’m not trying to offend you
Sophie yeah, you should stick to singing
‘Cause when you spit my ears are ringing
How can you shag bare lads
Is your fanny not stinging
I bet your fanny’s fucking minging
Sort out your manky Scouse brow
M to the B is coming at you with a row
You’re enough to turn all lads camp
You know that because you’re a fucking tramp
Repping around in your shit clothes
Like Josh said, what the fuck’s that pose?
Saying shit about people’s mums
That’s tight, Sophie Aspin do you want me a fight
Bet your blowies are fucking shite

Fucking shite, that’s what I said

That’s what I said so what’re you gonna do?
All the things you spit about aren’t even true
